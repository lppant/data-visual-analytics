1. What is the main reason to use a random forest versus a decision tree (using no more than 50 words)?
Ans: 
Decision trees improve accuracy with more and more splits and can easily overfit training data. 
So, in cases where we want better accuracy without overfitting and don't worry about model interpretability, we prefer to use random forest. 
Random forest controls overfitting by randomly selecting features to build trees.

2. How long did your random forest take to run (in seconds)?
Ans: Random forest took around 11 seconds to complete.

3. What accuracy (to two decimal places, xx.xx%) were you able to obtain?
Ans. Best accuracy obtained was 76.01%
